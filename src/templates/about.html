            It was created by Florian Bauer and Nathalie Pett at the University of Bristol in 2018/19 for the module M0010 Cloud Computing.
            The application is encapsulated into Docker containers run on a Kubernetes cluster and based on Microsoft Azure technologies.
            For the back-end the Flask framework for Python was used, while the frontend is implemented using Vue.js and Bootstrap.</p>
